{"name":"Eztables","tagline":"iptables made easy!","body":"# What is Eztables?\r\n\r\nEztables allows you to setup a firewall on a Linux system with human-friendly rules. Eztables manages the iptables rules for you, so you don't have to. The rules you have to write, are in a human-friendly, easy to understand format.\r\n\r\n# Example\r\n\r\nJust take a look at this example of a simple home or small-business networking setup:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n    nat $eth1_net $eth0\r\n    allow_forward $eth1_net any any any\r\n    allow_in $eth1_net $eth1 any 22/tcp\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou probably can figure out with ease what these rules do. The first one sets up NAT. The second one allows traffic to flow from within your network to the Internet and the last one allows SSH access to the firewall itself. \r\n\r\n# Why is Eztables cool?\r\n\r\nEztables offers a feature found in most commercial firewalls: it allows you to work with objects or groups.\r\nTake a look:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n    HTTP_SERVICES=\"\r\n        80/tcp\r\n       443/tcp\r\n    \"\r\n\r\n    WEB_SERVER_1=192.168.0.10\r\n    WEB_SERVER_2=192.168.0.11\r\n\r\n    WEB_SERVERS=\"\r\n        $WEB_SERVER_1\r\n        $WEB_SERVER_2\r\n    \"\r\n\r\n    allow_in any \"$WEB_SERVERS\" any \"$HTTP_SERVICES\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy defining groups of hosts, networks and services, you can keep the number firewall rules very small. This way, you don't get overwhelmed with rules and there is less risk of a typo creating an insecure configuration. You stay in control because you understand your rule base with a quick glance. \r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\nEztables is designed to be simple, yet powerful. It doesn't matter if you are setting up a home router, or use it to setup a corporate firewall. Eztables supports:\r\n\r\n* Basic input / output filtering\r\n* Network address translation (NAT)\r\n* Port address translation \r\n* Support for vlans\r\n* Service and host groups / objects\r\n* Logging to syslog\r\n* Support for plugins\r\n* Automatically detects all network interfaces\r\n\r\n# Where can I find more information?\r\n\r\nVisit the project page on github (blue button at the top of this page). There is a manual and some configuration examples.","google":"UA-5175176-11","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
